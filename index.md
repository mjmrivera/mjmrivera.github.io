- "Tell me about a challenging bug that you faced and how you solved it."
	- While troubleshooting wireguard, I came across a problem but I deleted the documentation so I do not have all the details. But basically, the problem was as follows: There was a loop that formed when an internal client that is in the same LAN as the wireguard server was not receiving ping responses when it pinged the wireguard server through the gateway WAN side external IP address. I solved it but it took a little bit of research.

## Challenging Issue:  Past Failure(s)
- I was working in Walmart as a frozen replenishment associate when I suffered some time loss due to prematurely putting pallets into the freezer when there was still new freight left behind. It happened early into my stay at Walmart so I was a beginner back then. I was focusing too much on other parts of my workflow that I made that honest mistake. So the lesson was: Do not overwhelm yourself.

## Challenging Issue: Difficult Customer
- **Difficult Customer**: "Tell me about a time when you dealt with a difficult customer."
	- I recall one time when I talked with a customer wanting to return something but he did not speak English so we had to use our phones to translate.
